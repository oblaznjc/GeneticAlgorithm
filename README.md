# GeneticAlgorithm
R_201: Genetic Algorithm Research Project (CSSE220)

For this project we wrote an evolutionary simulator from the ground up! Along the way I learned about GUIs, data presentation and analysis of simple experiments. In order to understand the key algorithm I studied and implemented, a Genetic Algorithm using the following resources:
